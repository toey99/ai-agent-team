## 02:11 AM - Sri Krung Broker Project Session

### ✅ Completed
- **Landing Page**: Created 7-section landing page for Sri Krung Broker (SriKrung 724) with insurance company logos, deployed on GitHub Pages at https://toey99.github.io/srikrung-landing/
- **Rich Menu**: Set up 3-button LINE Rich Menu (@vax7479a) with links to 724 purchase, member registration, and contact
- **Profile & Status**: LINE OA profile picture and status message configured

### ⚠️ Pending (Needs Fix)
- **AI Chatbot (Claude 3.5)**: Deployed on Render but responding with fallback messages only. Suspected issue: Environment Variables not being read correctly. Boss generated new API key but still not working. Needs debugging tomorrow.

### 📝 Notes
- Boss is persistent and detail-oriented, wants everything perfect
- Working late hours (past 2 AM) - both boss and I tired
- Boss prefers comprehensive solutions over quick fixes
- Multiple attempts made: Railway → Render, different API keys, Flask app setup

### 🎯 Next Steps (Morning)
1. Debug why Render can't read ANTHROPIC_API_KEY properly
2. Add print/debug statements to verify env var loading
3. Test AI chatbot responses
4. Alternative: Use LINE Auto-Reply if AI continues to fail

### 💰 Costs
- Render: Free tier (will sleep after 15 min inactivity)
- Claude API: $5 credit available, minimal usage so far
- GitHub Pages: Free
- LINE OA: Free
